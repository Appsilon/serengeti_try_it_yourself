# Serengeti - try it yourself
Try our model on your own images - check if it can spot any of the 53 species from Serengeti in any of your favourite photos.

To play with it you need to:
 - clone the repo, 
 - place the images you want to classify in the /images folder (only JPEGs and PNGs are supported)
 - run the classify_images notebook! (make sure you have all the necessary libraries installed)
