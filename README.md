<em>In this image our model correctly recognizes the Grant's gazelle, a Thomson's gazelle, and the zebras in the back</em>
</p>

Try our model on your own images - check if it can spot any of the 53 species from Serengeti in any of your favourite photos.

To play with it you need to:
 - clone the repo, 
 - place the images you want to classify in the /images folder (only JPEGs and PNGs are supported)
 - run the classify_images notebook! (make sure you have all the necessary libraries installed)

We have trained the model and used it to obtain 5th place in the <a href="https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/59/camera-trap-serengeti/">Hakuna Ma-data competition</a>.
